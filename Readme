Prog8051 is used to flash the P89V51RD2 microcontroller.
Based on the QT library, this tool can be recompiled on Linux,Wind0ze or Mac.

This program required qextserialport, a cross-platform QT serial library which I
have included for simplicity.


Because it is based on QT you will need the QT4 development tools installed to
complie this application.

To compile
	cd ./qextserialport
	qmake qextserialport.pro
	make
	cd ..
	qmake programmer.pro
	make
	
you may need to copy the serial library into the same directory as the executable.
