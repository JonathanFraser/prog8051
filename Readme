Prog8051 is used to flash the P89V51RD2 microcontroller.
Based on the QT library, this tool can be recompiled on Linux,Wind0ze or Mac.

This program required qextserialport, a cross-platform QT serial library which I
have included for simplicity.


Because it is based on QT you will need the QT4 development tools installed to
complie this application.

To compile
	cd ./qextserialport
	qmake qextserialport.pro
	make
	cd ..
	qmake programmer.pro
	make
	
The libraries for the serial port need to be copied to an available location
On windows copy the dll to the program directory or windows/system. On linux,
copy the *.so* to /usr/local/lib/ and run ldconfig
